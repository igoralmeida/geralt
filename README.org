#+TITLE:   Geralt - an Emacs frontend to grit

* Description

Geralt is a very thin wrapper on top of [[https://github.com/climech/grit][grit]], just to see if I could. The main
idea is to make the commands (add, delete, check, etc.) one or two keypresses
away.

It uses [[https://github.com/magit/transient][transient]] for the menus, and [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil][evil]] for the navigation.

* Prerequisites

- The =grit= binary
- transient and evil packages on your emacs

* Installation and configuration

- Put this folder in your load path and ~(require 'geralt)~.
  + ... or just open =geralt.el= and evaluate the buffer.
- After that, you might want to configure ~geralt-grit-executable~.

* Usage

Run the =geralt= command, for example with =M-x geralt=. Press =?= in a geralt buffer to see possible actions.

* Troubleshooting
